### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Imdad Shafi, a front-end developer with over 5 years of experience in the industry. My journey started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I have since worked with various frameworks like Bootstrap, Bulma, and Tailwind CSS. I am also familiar with popular tools like GitHub, Webpack, and Babel, and currently use VS Code as my go-to editor.

Apart from traditional front-end development, I have also worked on many WordPress projects using Timber and Twig templating engines. Currently, I am working as a front-end developer at The Brand Crew Pvt. Ltd., a media agency where I create engaging and responsive user interfaces for our clients.

I am passionate about creating clean and accessible code and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies or tinkering with my side projects.
